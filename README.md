# beta_beat_estimation
Code to plot betabeating in a dynamic squeeze. The plots are generated by running: ``run_beta_beat_estimation.py``. The corrections are calculated at the optics defined in ``OPTICSFILES_CORRECTION`` and evaluated at the opticsfiles defined in ``OPTICSFILES``. The quadrupole errors are added with the install_errors() macro in ``base_scripts/andreas_macros.madx``, with the random seeds specified in ``SEEDS``.

The plots where presented at the LHC run 3 meeting on the 18th of june 2021:
